Project  Algorithms_AutoComplete

Alogorithms first assignment, implementing an autocomplete interface. Bruteforce first followed by a quicker autocomplete. 
Due to the amount of time(see commets) i put into this assignment, i could not give any more time to it with out neglecting other subjects
So could not finish the assignment completely, will return to this after the semester.

What was complete, 
AutoComplete interface:
Term class: Reads in terms from a .txt file saves to an array.
BruteAutocomplete class : Takes in the term array and searchs for best match, the weight of term and all matches
Client class: Cli interface driven class, allows user to input a prefix to be searched calling methods from brute auto
BruteAutoTest class: This class tests the bruteauto methods

Other classes (left uncomplete)
QuickAutoComplete class: implements autocomplete
TermComparator and TermbyTermComparator: The begining of comparing terms in order to sort them more efficiently before implimenting a 
faster search method ie BinarySearch or QuickSearch
